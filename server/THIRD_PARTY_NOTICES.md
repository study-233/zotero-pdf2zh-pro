# Bundled runtime snapshots

`zotero-pdf2zh-pro` bundles fixed, source-readable runtime snapshots so its
PyPI package does not resolve a newer `pdf2zh-next` release or install the
upstream Gradio/FastAPI web UI.

The `pdf2zh-next` Gradio GUI modules and BabelDOC development tools are not
included. Translation providers, PDF processing, OCR models, table handling,
and glossary extraction remain included. Exact license texts are under
`LICENSES/` and are copied into wheel metadata.
