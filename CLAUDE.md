Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Project Notes

- This repo ships the server through multiple targets: local `uv`, Docker, and Homebrew.
- Keep the plugin and server version aligned. When bumping a release, update both `plugin/package.json` and the server version fields in `server/pyproject.toml` and `server/server.py`.
- The server is published to PyPI as `zotero-pdf2zh-pro`; `scripts/release.sh <version>` is the unified release path for XPI, PyPI, the Windows/friends packages, and optional Homebrew updates.
- When changing server packaging or startup behavior, also review:
  - `server/pyproject.toml`
  - `server/uv.lock`
  - `server/Dockerfile`
  - `compose.yaml`
  - the private Homebrew tap `study-233/homebrew-formula`, formula `Formula/zotero-pdf2zh-pro.rb`
- The Homebrew formula should stay aligned with the server CLI entrypoint and currently must pin `python@3.13` instead of unversioned `python`, because the `pdf2zh_next -> pydantic-core` dependency chain does not currently build correctly on Python 3.14.
- The Homebrew tap remote is `git@github.com:study-233/homebrew-formula.git`. Use `--tap-path` or let the release script use a temporary clone; never add a personal absolute path.
- The tap is source-only and intentionally does not publish bottles. Update its `version` and git `revision`, push `main`, and wait for `formula-checks.yml`.
- The plugin repository is private, so the plugin has no automatic update URL. Friends receive XPI and source through the generated friends package.
- Do not update only one distribution target if the change affects all startup/install paths.
